Work on projects is organised according to scrum. Depending on the number
of registrations we will have one or more teams with up to 5 team members
each.

Each team assigns a scrum master to take over all tasks necessary to
enable the team to work smoothly and remove any impediments stopping the
team from accomplishing their goals.

Each week we meet, demonstrate what was done in the past week and
according to priorities set by the product owner (identical to course
tutor) select what to work on the next week.

   * General outline of work process.
   * Assignment of students to development presentations.

Second meetup:
   * Presentation of development presentations.
